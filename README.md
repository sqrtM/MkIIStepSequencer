# MkIIStepSequencer
Step Sequencer functionality for the Arturia MkII.

note to self before I forget it later: in the Sequencer constructor, you should create an instance of a "clock" or "metronome" or something and give it to each of the banks. The clock will keep track of the timing of everything and send signals to each bank.
