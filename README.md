# MkIIStepSequencer

### Step Sequencer functionality for the Arturia MkII. 

(working on this when I get the chance ðŸ™‡)

This is the result of a pretty long reverse engineering project I've been doing, trying to basically create a better version of Arturia's MIDI Control Hub and step sequencer. 

I've seen some whispers about a project like this on forums over the last few years, but I don't think I've seen anyone else make a fully featured step sequencer, so I'm doing my best to make one. I'll probably make a blog post with all the information I've gathered so other people can have fun hacking their Arturia stuff as well.

Allows different banks of sequencers to operate on their own thread and full GUI I/O
